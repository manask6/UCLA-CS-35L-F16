First, used "sort --version" command and found that we have coreutils 8.25.

Then, we make the file with 10,000,000 doubles:
Just using the od command won't be enough, since this won't put all the 
numbers on separate lines or get rid of the parts that aren't numbers.
Thus, we get:
od -tf -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom 
	| sed 's/^[0-9]* *//' 
	| tr -s ' ' '\n' > ./test.txt

The -N 80000000 is for 80000000 bytes which makes 10000000 doubles.
The tr portion replaces spaces with newlines.
The sed part removes any number that is only numerals and has no . or +.

Now we use time -p to time the sort command on this data.
We'll do this with the --parallel option set to off, 1, 2, 4, and 8:

time -p sort -g test.txt > /dev/null
real 34.70
user 195.86
sys 0.52

time -p sort -g --parallel=1 test.txt > /dev/null
real 183.81
user 183.68
sys 0.23

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 test.txt > /dev/null
real 96.74
user 184.96
sys 0.39

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 test.txt > /dev/null
real 35.11
user 194.85
sys 0.51

Using --parallel=8 gives us the best real time, but not necesarilly the best
user or sys times, compared to the other --parallel setitngs. This real time
is very close to that from the first command where --parallel is not invoked.
This suggests that the default behaviour of sort is to set parallel
to 8 to take advantage of multiple cores.
