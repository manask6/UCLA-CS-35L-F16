1.
If an opposing team could snoop on all the bytes sent and recieved over the 
network, the connection would still be secure. This is because the information
that they could recover would be encrypted with the receiver's public key, and
could only be decrypted with that person's own private key.

However, if the opposing team was able to install a keylogger on our keyboards,
they might be able to unencrypt this information because the keylogger would
give them the password we set in the beggining of the lab that acted as the
authentication private key. This would allow them to create a session key for
themselves.

Finally, if the opposing team had access to the USB connection used to boot up
Ubuntu, they would have access to all the files in Ubuntu. This would include 
the .ssh files we created when we set up our server, and these files include
the public and private keys that were used for creating the authentication and
sessions keys. These keys would allow them to decrypt any information sent to
or from the server.

The "gpg --verify" command doesn't verify the original owner of the tar file.
Instead, it only can compare the cleartext signature using the public key. This
signature can probably be forged or changed once the file is created. To solve
this, we can maintain a separate database of files and their original authors.
