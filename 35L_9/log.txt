Partner: Hana Kim (acting as server)

First, we both booted up Ubuntu, since doing this lab on the SEASnet servers
without root access would be a bad idea.

Then we made sure we had the needed openssh files with the command:
dpkg --get selections | grep openssh

It turns out we didn't, so we got them with the commands:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Next, Hana started setting up the server. She used the command "ssh-keygen"
to generate her public and private keys for encryption. Then she made an
account for me to access her server with the commands:
sudo useradd -d /home/manas -m hana
sudo passwd hana

At this point, she made a directory named "manas" for me to access with the
username "hana" and the password "hana".

After this she created a .ssh directory in the directory "manas" to store the 
RSA encrypction keys with the following commands:
cd /home/manas
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R hana .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Those last two commands allowed me to add or edit any files in the "manas"
folder by making me the owner.

Next, I generated my public and private keys with the "ssh-keygen" command,
and I copied my public key to the server and added my private key to the
authentication agent with the commands:
ssh-copy-id -i hana@[server ip]
ssh-add

The [server ip] part in that first command was the Hana's ip address that was
taken from the "ifconfig" command.

After all this, I logged on to Hana's server with the command:
ssh -X hana@[server ip]

To test my connection, I tried to open firefox through the server with the 
"firefox" command and it worked.

We switched places as server and client and did the process quickly once more,
pretty much doing everything described above.
