First step: fix LC_CTYPE with export command as described in assignment
Then: use sort /usr/share/dict/words > ./words.txt to get sorted words.txt

Used wget to get html copy of assignment page


tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html
-This command displays all words in the html file that have english letters in them in the order they appear

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html
-This command does the same thing but repeated entries are not shown

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html | sort
-This command does the same as before but displays entries in alphabetical order

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html | sort -u
-This command does the same but only shows the first entry in an "equal run"

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html | sort -u | comm - words
-This command compares the output of above with the "words" file line by line

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < Assignment2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words
-This command displays all words in the html file (after being sorted) that don't appear in the words file


Used wget to get html copy of English to Hawaiian webpage
Used following shell script to properly sort and arrange Hawaiian words:

#!/bin/bash

grep -o -E '*<td>.*</td>' e2h.html	// Takes all words between <td> HTML flags	
| sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'			// Removes all HTML tags
| sed 's/(.*)//g'			// Removes everything in parenthesis
| sed '/^\s*$/d'			// Removes unecessary spaces
| sed -n '1~2!p'			// Removes every other line
| sed 's/'\`'/'\''/g'			// Changes ` to '
| sed 's/'\,'//g'			// Removes all commas
| tr" " "\n"				// Replaces all spaces with newlines
| sort -u -f				// Sort alphabetically, no repeats
| tail -n +2				// First line was showing up as blank, so remove it
| tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'		// Change everything to lowercase
| sed '/[pk'\''mnwlhaeiou]/!d'		// Remove any non-Hawaiian words


Used buildwords script to spellcheck webpage like so:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <Assignment2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - ./buildwords

Found words like "you" "want" and "save" that were English but not Hawaiian
Found words like "halau" and "kula" that were Hawaiian but not English
