First, used wget to get the Coreutils tarball using link from assignment page.
Then, used tar -xvzf to unzip it.
Then, read INSTALL file.
Then, used ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/kumar/coreutilsInstall
Used make and make install commands to fully install coreutils.

Went to ~/coreutilsInstall/bin folder and tried that folder's ls -l command.
Command produced dates in YYYY-MM-DD format,
	whereas normal ls command produced them in Month Day YYYY format.
	(commands used were ls and ./ls)
Created PATCH file in coreutils-7.6 and copied text from assignment into file
Used patch -p1 < ./PATCH command, Hunk #1 and Hunk#2 succeeded

Tried coreutil's ls command again, got Month Day YYYY format.
This ls command does not color code files.
Used touch -d '1 May 2005 10:22' ./yes to make yes file old.
Coreutil's ls command shows year instead of time for files older than one year.
