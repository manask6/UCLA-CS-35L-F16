1. The line above "case_long_iso_time_style:", is not needed because of the line
   "case long_iso_time_style:" right above it.

2. The Brady patch messes with localization and thus would make reading dates
   confusing for people not used to English-format dates. Also if there is any
   software out there that relies on the numeric date format, it will not work
   with this patch installed.

3. When randline.py is invoked on an empty file, we get the error,
   "IndexError: list index out of range" beacuse the random.choice function expects
   at least on item in the list. Accessing an item at any index from a list of 0 items
   is impossible to resolve.

4. On python 3, this same script when invoked gives an invalid syntax error for line 65.
   Simply put, this is because python 3 has a different syntax than python 2 and the
   comma notation used doesn't work.
